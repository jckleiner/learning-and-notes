# Markdown editors

### Typora ✅

* Seems to be the best option for now

### Vscode with extension

* "Markdown all in One" (preview with: CMD+K, ) and "Markdown Paste" (paste with: Option+CMD+V) extension
* No WYSIWYG support, need to be split screen

### Mark Text ❌

Has 2 modes:

1. Source Code mode: shows raw markdown
2. WYSIWYG mode

Pros:

* WYSIWYG support
* File strucre view
* Customizable
* Nice design

Cons:

* Undo/Redo is since 2019 buggy

## Zettlr ❌

Pros:

* File strucre view
* Customizable
* Nice design

Cons:

* Does not have a preview mode which means it is not WYSIWYG but instead WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean)
